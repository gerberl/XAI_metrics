# XAI Objective Metrics

Our implementation/proposal of XAI objective metrics such as monotonicity, complexity, and information gain.

To add it to a local instalation, probably the easiest is:

`pip install git+https://github.com/gerberl/XAI_metrics.git`

If you'd like to edit it locally, probably best to `git clone` it and then `pip install -e .` from the package's root directory.
